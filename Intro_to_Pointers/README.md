This repository holds examples of code using pointers to display
the basic use of pointers

Example 0
This function just prints the variable num to the console

Example 1
This function declares a pointer variable ptr and sets its value
to the address of our num variable

Example 2
This function adds on the previous one to dereference the value
of our num variable using the our pointer

Example 3
This function uses our pointer variable to change the value of
num, and also creates a new variable that's value will be taken
from the num variable through our pointer variable
